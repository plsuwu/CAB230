# CAB230 - Web Computing

code submitted for assignments two and three as part of [CAB230](https://www.qut.edu.au/study/unit?unitCode=CAB230).

> not too fond of react and react-like patterns but at least its not c#.

note that these two projects are only *thematically* connected such that the client and server are not actually functionally tied, though the API used in the client would likely offer almost identical functionality.

## A2 - Clientside:

> i think the clientside source code is a little messy and, given more time, would liked to have refactored large sections of code (i may still posthumously do so).
 
- Vite + React + Typescript
- React Router
- TailwindCSS

## A3 - Serverside:

- Express + Typescript also
- MariaDB (or MySQL) + Knex
- Zod (largely unnecessary - I wanted to try Zod out and I thought it wound up being a pretty tidy way to handle bad user input)
- Swagger documentation served on the root endpoint
