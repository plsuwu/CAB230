# Volcanic Archive - CAB230, React Clientside

re*ct.....

- Vite + React + Typescript
- React Router
- TailwindCSS
 
**caching**

the set of utils in `src/lib/cache/*` is a neat little custom caching utility written in an attempt to emulate Sveltekit's state management with the `'svelte/store'` module.

- its incomplete and also somewhat reasonable if u call it insane but im trying to make react bearable :)
