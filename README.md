## caching

`src/lib/cache/*` is a fun little custom caching utility written in an attempt to emulate Sveltekit's state management with the `'svelte/store'` module.

 - need to describe how this system works for myself in 3 hours time because i've sat here writing it for a good ~10-15 hours straight and in its a rough (possibly insane and unhinged) state i'm definitely going to forget how it
works as soon as i take a break and as such i will never finish it.
